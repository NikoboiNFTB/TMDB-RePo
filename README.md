# 🎬 IMDb RePo: Simple & Fast Redirect Portal

>> Note: This project is a fork of [IMDb RePo](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo).

**IMDb RePo** is a lightweight, dependency-free userscript that adds links to movie, TV and Season pages for instant redirection to external streaming. Simple, fast, and smooth — Sailing the High Seas done right!

## 🚀 Features

  - Automatically finds the ID and constructs the link!  
    - On Movie pages → `https://111movies.com/movie/{TMDB-ID}`  
    - On TV Show pages → `htps://111movies.com/tv/{TMDB-ID}/1/1`  
    - On Season pages → `https://111movies.com/tv/{TMDB-ID}/S/E`

- ⚡ **Instant Load**  
  Buttons appear before the full page finishes loading.

- 🧩 **Tiny & Readable**  
  Fully self-contained. No dependencies. Easy to tweak.

## 🛠 Installation

1. **Install a Userscript Manager**  
   Recommended: Firefox + Violentmonkey  
   - [Violentmonkey (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/)  
   - [Tampermonkey (Chromium)](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)  
   >> *Firefox + Violentmonkey are recommended because they are both Free and Open-Source. However, neither is available on Chromium. On Chromium, the proprietary Tampermonkey extension is recommended.*

2. **Install the Script** (choose one way, listed easiest to hardest)  
   - Click [here](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/TMDB-RePo/raw/refs/heads/main/tmdb-repo-1.0.user.js) and install when prompted.  
   - Copy-paste all code into a new userscript.  
   - Or download the `.user.js` file manually and import it.

3. **Done. Enjoy.**

>> **Chrome / Edge / Brave Users:**  
>> Make sure Tampermonkey can actually *run* userscripts:  
>> - Go to `chrome://extensions/` (or equivalent)  
>> - Click **Details** under Tampermonkey  
>> - Enable **“Allow access to file URLs”**, **“Allow User Scripts”** and **"Developer Mode"**, then hit **"Update"**
>> - Re-open the IMDb tab. Reloading wasn't enough in my testing.
>>   - Yes, this is a bit annoying, and yes, it's Chromium's fault, and no, I can't fix this.

## **Recommended 111Movies Tweaks**  

   - [`Remove Player Gradient`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/raw/refs/heads/main/111movies-gradient-1.0.user.js)  
     Removes the persistent shadow overlay on the player.  

   - [`Hide Server`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/raw/refs/heads/main/111movies-server-1.2.user.js)  
     Hides the server button along with the rest of the Player UI.

   - [`Hide Cursor`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/raw/refs/heads/main/111movies-cursor-1.2.user.js)  
     Hides the cursor with the rest of the Player GUI when not hovering over player controls.  
     - Brute force, but works. Contributions for a more elegant solution are welcome.

   - [`Add Page Title`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/raw/refs/heads/main/111movies-title-1.0.user.js)  
     Add a page title based on IMDb ID.
     - For example, the title `South Park (TV Series 1997– ) - IMDb` becomes `South Park (TV Series 1997– ) - 111Movies`.

   - [`Add Page Favicon`](https://github.com/NikoboiNFTB/IMDb-RePo/raw/refs/heads/main/111movies-favicon-1.2.user.js)  
     Fetches the 111Movies logo from [`https://111movies.com/assets/img/logo.png`](https://111movies.com/assets/img/logo.png)

## 💡 How to Use

1. Open any **Movie**, **TV Show** or **Season** page on TMDB.  
2. A new button appears next to *Play trailer/clip/featurette* or in case of Season pages, next to the episode's *Title*;  
   - **Watch** → Hit **Watch** to redirect to **111Movies**  

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Doesn’t check if the content actually exists
  - Though it usually does, new releases are usually available within a day or two.  
- Redirect domain is hardcoded to `111movies.com` (feel free to fork and change it).
